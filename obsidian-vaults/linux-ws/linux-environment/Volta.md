# Volta: The JavaScript Tool Manager

Volta is a fast and hassle-free manager for your JavaScript command-line tools. Think of it like `nvm` or `pyenv`, but for the entire Node.js ecosystem (Node, npm, pnpm, yarn).

Its main philosophy is to "get out of your way." You install it once, and it automatically switches tool versions based on the project you're in.

---
## 🤔 Why Use Volta?

- **Project-Specific Versions:** This is its killer feature. You can "pin" a specific version of Node.js or pnpm to a project by running `volta pin node@18` inside the project's directory. Anyone else who clones your project and has Volta installed will automatically use that exact version, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.
- **Global Tools without the Mess:** When you install a global tool like `pnpm` or `typescript` with Volta, it's installed in a central location (`~/.volta`) but is available everywhere. It keeps your system clean.
- **Speed:** It's written in Rust, so it's incredibly fast.

---
## ⚙️ How to Install
Volta has a simple universal installer that works on any Linux distro.

- **Installation Command:**
  > curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

- **Post-Install:** You need to **open a new terminal session** for the `volta` command to become available, as the installer adds its directory to your `$PATH` in your shell's startup file (like `~/.zshrc`).

## 🚀 Common Commands

- **To Install the latest LTS version of Node.js:**
  > volta install node

- **To Install a specific version of Node.js:**
  > volta install node@20

- **To Install a package manager (like pnpm) globally:**
  > volta install pnpm

- **To Pin a tool version to the current project:**
  > volta pin node@18.17.0
  >
  > *This will create a `package.json` file if one doesn't exist and add a `"volta"` section to it.*

- **To See What's Installed:**
  > volta list all

> **My Workflow:** In my architecture, I don't install Volta on the Host system. Instead, I install it inside my development containers like `[[ubuntu-clean]]`. This provides ==complete isolation== for my development toolchains, keeping the Host system pristine.
