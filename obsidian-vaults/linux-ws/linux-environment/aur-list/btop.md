# btop: The Resource Monitor

`btop` is my primary, feature-rich resource monitor that runs in the terminal. It's a modern C++ rewrite of `bpytop` and `bashtop`, making it extremely fast and responsive.

It provides a comprehensive, real-time dashboard of my entire system's performance.

---
## 🤔 Why It's My Go-To Monitor
- **Visually Rich:** Shows detailed graphs for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage over time.
- **Fully Themable:** The entire color scheme can be customized. My setup uses a theme generated by `[[wallust]]` to match my wallpaper.
- **Interactive Process Management:** It's easy to navigate, filter, search, and kill processes without typing any commands.
- **Detailed Info:** Shows CPU temperatures, disk I/O, network speeds, and a full process tree.

---
## ⚙️ How to Install
`btop` is available in the Arch `community` repository.

- **Installation Command:**
  > paru -S btop

---
## 🛠️ My Configuration
All my `btop` settings are managed through my `[[wallust-dotfiles]]` and deployed with `[[stow]]`.

- **Config File Location:** `~/.config/btop/btop.conf`
- **Theme Files:** Located in `~/.config/btop/themes`. My `wallust.omp.json` theme is a custom one generated by `[[wallust]]`.

## 🚀 How to Use & Keybindings
`btop` is a TUI (Text User Interface), so you interact with it using keyboard shortcuts.

- **To Launch:**
  > btop

### Keybindings Inside the App
-   **`m`** or **`ESC`**: Show the main menu.
-   **`Up` / `Down`**: Select a process.
-   **`h`**, **`j`**, **`k`**, **`l`**: Navigate processes (Vim style).
-   **`Enter`**: View detailed information about the selected process.
-   **`f`**: Open the filter input box (type to search for processes).
-   **`t`**: Terminate (kill) the selected process.
-   **`k`**: Force kill the selected process.
-   **`<`** and **`>`**: Cycle through the columns for sorting processes.
-   **`p`**: Cycle through process grouping modes.
-   **`+`** and **`-`**: Expand/collapse the selected process in the process tree.

-   **`q`**: Quit the application.

> **My Workflow:** While I use `[[bottom]]` for quick checks inside [[AstroNvim]], I open `btop` in a dedicated [[Kitty]] window when I need a full, detailed overview of my system's health, especially for monitoring temperatures and memory usage.
