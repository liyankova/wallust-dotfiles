# yt-dlp: The Ultimate Video Downloader

`yt-dlp` is a powerful command-line tool for downloading videos and audio from YouTube and thousands of other websites. It's a feature-rich fork of the original `youtube-dl` and is now considered the modern standard due to its active development and speed.

## 🤔 Why It's So Useful
- **Universal:** It lets me grab a copy of almost any online video for offline viewing or for use in my projects.
- **Audio Extraction:** It can easily rip the audio from a video, which is perfect for getting soundtracks, podcasts, or lecture audio.
- **Playlist Power:** It can download an entire playlist or channel with a single command, saving a huge amount of time.
- **Full Control:** It's scriptable, fast, and gives me complete control over the format, quality, subtitles, and metadata of the downloaded files.

## ⚙️ How to Install
`yt-dlp` is available in the Arch `extra` repository. For full functionality (like merging video/audio or converting formats), it needs `ffmpeg`.

- **Installation Command:**
  > paru -S --needed yt-dlp ffmpeg

---
## 🚀 Common Commands / Usecase
The basic syntax is simply `yt-dlp [OPTIONS] URL`.

- **To Download a Video (Best Available Quality):**
  > yt-dlp "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."

- **To List All Available Formats for a Video:**
  *This is useful when you want a specific resolution or file size.*
  > yt-dlp -F "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."

- **To Download a Specific Format:**
  *Use the format codes from the list generated by the `-F` flag.*
  > \# Download format code 22 (usually a 720p mp4)
  > yt-dlp -f 22 "https://..."
  >
  > \# A better way: download best video and best audio and merge them
  > yt-dlp -f "bv+ba" "https://..."

- **To Download Audio Only (and convert to MP3):**
  *The `-x` flag extracts the audio.*
  > yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "https://..."

- **To Download an Entire Playlist:**
  > yt-dlp "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=..."

- **To Download Only a Few Videos from a Playlist:**
  > \# Download videos 1, 3, and from 5 to 7
  > yt-dlp --playlist-items 1,3,5-7 "https://..."

> **My Workflow:** As a content creator, this tool is indispensable. I often use `yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3` to download royalty-free music from YouTube for my videos. It's also great for saving conference talks or tutorials for offline viewing when I'm traveling.
