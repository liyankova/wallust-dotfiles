# AppImageLauncher

`AppImageLauncher` is a fantastic helper utility that makes using `.AppImage` files feel like you're installing a native application. Its main job is to automate the tedious manual steps of managing AppImages.

---
## 🤔 Why It's Useful
Without AppImageLauncher, you have to:
1.  Create a dedicated folder for your AppImages.
2.  Manually move the downloaded file there.
3.  Make it executable with `chmod`.
4.  Manually create a `.desktop` file so it shows up in your app launcher ([[Rofi]]).

AppImageLauncher does **all of this automatically**.

## ⚙️ How to Install
On Arch-based systems, the stable version is available in the official `community` repository, which is much better than trying to build the `-git` version from the [[AUR]].

- **Installation Command:**
  > paru -S appimagelauncher

---
## 🚀 Usecase & Workflow
There's no command to run. AppImageLauncher works by intercepting the first time you run a new AppImage.

1.  **Download** an `.AppImage` file (e.g., to `~/Downloads`).
2.  **Make it executable.** This is the only manual step you still need to do.
    > chmod +x ~/Downloads/SomeApp.AppImage
3.  **Run it for the first time.**
    > ~/Downloads/SomeApp.AppImage
4.  A dialog box from AppImageLauncher will pop up, asking what to do.
5.  Choose the option **"Integrate and run"**.

That's it. AppImageLauncher will then automatically:
- **Move** the `.AppImage` file to a central location (usually `~/Applications`).
- **Create** a `.desktop` file for it in `~/.local/share/applications`.
- **Launch** the application.

From now on, you can launch the app directly from [[Rofi]], just like any other program.

> **To Uninstall:** AppImageLauncher also has a right-click context menu entry (in GUI file managers) to "Remove AppImage from system", which cleanly deletes both the file and its shortcut.
