## Skipped Packages (And Why)

As requested, I'm skipping a few that don't really need their own detailed note:

- `preload`: This is a background service. Once you enable it, you don't interact with it directly, so there are no commands for a cheat sheet.
- `quickshell`: This is another terminal emulator. Since your workflow is fully built around Kitty and its scratchpad feature, a note for this would be redundant.
- `ttf-victor-mono`: This is a font file. It has no commands or user interaction after installation.
